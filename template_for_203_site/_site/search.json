People often use these words in the same way, but they mean different things. Students usually learn about computers and then get jobs where they write code. “Software engineering” sounds more detailed, like it uses deeper knowledge, similar to jobs like building planes or bridges. But making software hasn’t always been as strict or careful as these jobs. As we use software more in our daily lives, we need to be more careful making it. This book gives tips on how to do that better.\n\n\nReflection\nAfter reflecting on the preface of this book, I feel that I will gain a different perspective on the world of computer science. I say this because I never realized how the terms “programming” and “software egineering” tie hand and hand. I feel that after reading this book I will learn about the evolution of programming and software egineering and overall gain a better understanding of the two.\n\n\nUse-Case\nThe information I absored from the topics covered in this reading can apply to the Chasten project in many ways. For one understanding the differences between programming and software engineering will lead us to define roles clearly when working together. Furthermore, the continuous learning aspect of it. Since software engineering is always evolving, as stated in the preface, it will be encouraged for us students to continously update the project."

It underlined how testing helps identify and address issues, improving software’s stability and dependability. Yet, it also made clear that testing can’t promise error-free code. Using an example like the divide-by-zero issue in the square root function, the chapter demonstrated the variation of testing, enhancing my grasp of this key software component.\n\n\nReflection\nAfter reading and reflecting on this chapter of Fuzzing Book I realized how essential testing is to coding Testing helps you find the very small errors with your code that you may not realize is in your code.\n\n\nUse-Case\nThe information I learned can be implemented in the chasten project in many ways. For example testing is somethig that will be used in our program in order to check if our codes are running properly."

It talks about how long the code will be used and its ability to change with new tech or business needs. Making software involves teamwork and has its own challenges, like organizing the team and setting rules. As a project grows, it needs to work well and grow properly. Making decisions in software is complex, and sometimes you have to choose between not-so-perfect options. A software engineer’s job is to aim for long-lasting software and manage the growth of the project.\n\n\nReflection\nThis text emphasizes the need for forward-thinking in software creation. The idea is to think about keeping software good for years, not just for a short time, which promotes a flexible approach. Hyrum’s Law shows how developers often use what they see in software, even if it’s not a main part. The chapter also talks about the importance of individual learning and sharing what you know. This personal development helps the whole organization move forward.\n\n\nUse-Case\nI believe it’s crucial when developing software for our project to consider the trade-offs involved. It’s essential to understand the advantages and disadvantages of our software before releasing it. We shouldn’t release software that has major flaws that could harm our code."

It shows how important it is for finding software flaws and gives useful tips on how to use techniques that guide fuzzing with coverage. This part also explains white box and black box testing, which are crucial for making sure software is of high quality. White box testing looks at the code inside, whereas black box testing checks how it works from the outside without knowing the internal details.\n\n\nReflection\nIn this section, I learned a lot about how important testing is in creating software. The chapter really focused on the need to test in many different situations, not just on writing the code. It’s about making sure the code works right and can handle different situations. The book also went through different ways to fix problems in the code, and I thought that part was really helpful.\n\n\nUse-Case\nFor our goal, it’s very important to write good test cases to make sure the project stays in great shape for a long time. We have to make testing just as important as making and putting in new code."

It emphasizes values like being humble, respectful, and trustworthy. While some people believe in the idea of a lone developer, real success in software comes from teams working well together. For software groups to last and do well, they need a strong team-focused culture, not just individual work. This mindset helps teams be creative, take risks, and understand that mistakes happen, all while supporting each other.\n\n\nReflection\nThis article really opened my eyes. I’ve never made software with a team before, so all of this is new to me. Learning about how to work well in a team is helpful\n\n\nUse-Case\nThe guide discussed in the chapter can be a great tool for our software engineering class, especially during tough projects. It can assist us in building an effective team. For example, if there’s a difficult system or method, rather than pushing back against it, we can aim to get it and adjust by collaborating and finding solutions as a team."

The main point of the chapter is the importance of using automated tools for fuzzing to find and fix issues quickly and effectively. This makes the chapter a must-read for those aiming to improve software strength and safety.\n\n\nUse-Case\nThe chapter gives us deep knowledge about fuzzing, showing its importance in testing. Just as working together is key in software, fuzzing is a great and affordable way to better test our code and find weak spots in our software. We could use this method to test the Chasten program, especially for bugs caused by inputting code or using config files. While this method could be very useful for Chasten, I think it might be even more beneficial later in the semester when we begin working on the Astronaught tool."

An organization in this field is essentially a team of engineers and developers working together to build and take care of software. Like in any group, there are hurdles that need to be jumped over to reach success in your project or final objective. Sometimes, software organizations struggle to build a learning environment where everyone feels comfortable admitting what they don’t know in order to learn from their peers. It’s about being willing to share your own gaps in knowledge to benefit from the knowledge of others. You have to be open and share to learn and grow.\n\n\nReflection\nReading through the chapter made me think about what is needed to create a space where everyone is always learning. You need to make sure that if you don’t know something in a particular area, you talk to others and ask for help. This is true for experts in a field as well. As a software engineer, it’s crucial to step out of your comfort zone and take on new challenges. You should also be ready to help out and share what you know with others who might not be as far along as you are, whether it’s in a specific area or in solving a particular problem.\n\n\nUse-Case\nI believe that as a class, we are gradually getting a better grasp of chasten’s tools and their functions during its development process. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to acknowledge that some of us are progressing faster than others. Those who are more advanced should be willing to share their insights and knowledge. Additionally, when selecting issues to address, it’s vital to diversify our focus. This includes working on problems related to both the source code and the documentation."

It checks if the tests can notice small tweaks or mutations in a function’s source code. The book refers to these tweaks as “artificial faults.” Here’s an example to show what that means:\ndef triangle_m1(a, b, c):\n    if a == b:\n        if b == c:\n            return 'Equilateral'\n        else:\n            # return 'Isosceles'\n            return None  # &lt;-- injected fault\n    else:\n        if b == c:\n            return \"Isosceles\"\n        else:\n            if a == c:\n                return \"Isosceles\"\n            else:\n                return \"Scalene\"\n\n\nReflection\nThe idea of mutation analysis from the Fuzzing Book’s chapter gives us a useful way to see how good our test collections really are. It shows that just looking at how much of the structure the tests cover isn’t enough, as it doesn’t always mean the program’s results will be right. The code samples given, named ineffective_test_1 and ineffective_test_2, clearly show the difference between getting a lot of coverage and actually finding the software’s errors.\n\n\nUse-Case\nIn chasten, it’s crucial to apply the new methods we pick up during this course, whether it’s for writing test cases or handling source code. Our goal should be to create software that’s reliable and free from bugs; the more we can do that, the better. As we go through our textbooks, we should focus on discovering new approaches to tasks and then bring that understanding into our project."

It highlights the need for more variety and acceptance in the field to make sure software is made for all kinds of users. The chapter explains that unintentional bias can hurt groups of people who are not well represented, leading to problems in creating products. For example, it brings up a situation where Google’s picture-identifying technology didn’t take race into account, showing how things can go wrong. The chapter underlines how crucial it is for engineers to learn about and understand different kinds of users and their challenges, and it talks about the need for teams to be culturally diverse. It pushes for a design approach that includes everyone from the start and puts responsibility on engineers to create fair systems. The chapter encourages constant learning and progress, checking how fair systems are, and working with experts in diversity and inclusion to make software that is more inclusive.\n\n\nReflection\nAfter reading this chapter, I realized that while I haven’t directly faced biases in software, I’ve definitely come across stories and examples of it. Being a software engineer, it’s crucial to understand the significant impact and influence we hold. The tools and software we create can deeply affect a person’s life and feelings based on their interactions with them.\n\n\nUse-Case\nThinking about our chasten project, I notice there’s a bias because the program only supports Python source code at the moment."

It admits that there’s still a lot of work to do before the industry can truly be inclusive and diverse. It urges a change in thinking – instead of making products for everyone, we should be making products with everyone, bringing users into every part of the product development process. It emphasizes that engineers need to think about how their products affect all kinds of users and questions old ways of doing things that put quick results before fairness.\n\n\nUse-Case\nWhile using chasten, I believe tools like integrate and datasette could use mutation-based fuzzing during testing.

Both roles are crucial to a team’s success and need to be present at the same time. The chapter also introduces the idea of servant leadership, which aims to foster a culture of humility, respect, and trust, while meeting the needs of the team members and ensuring their well-being. Additionally, the chapter talks about “Antipatterns,” which are behaviors and practices that managers should avoid. Examples of these harmful patterns include hiring people who are easy to control and manipulate, overlooking team members who are struggling with their technical work, and neglecting the personal needs of the team.\n\n\nReflection\nManagers and tech leads need different abilities. It’s possible to be both. However, a manager typically guides people and organizes plans to complete tasks, while a tech lead takes charge of engineering projects and helps with various software applications. I see myself as a mix of both, but I lean more towards being a tech lead. When I really grasp a topic, I take the lead on engineering tasks and provide assistance with various software applications in that domain.\n\n\nUse-Case\nAs a group, we have several individuals ready to step up and take on managerial roles at times, and as the semester progresses, more people are becoming comfortable with leading the class. However, we face challenges because we lack a sufficient number of tech leads, and we aren’t all working together in the same space on the project. I believe that if we had class time dedicated to active communication, where everyone could discuss their challenges and share their knowledge, we would be in a much better position."

The key to being a good leader, the chapter says, is to create teams that can operate independently, foster strong leadership, establish good ways of working, and keep a culture of sticking with it over time.\n\n\nReflection\nThe chapter describes how an engineer grows into a leadership role, moving away from just technical work to making big decisions and leading a team. It highlights how important it is for leaders to let their team members do things on their own and to not spread themselves too thin, while still helping their team improve. The ideas of Deciding, Leaving, and Scaling are given as a simple guide to being a good leader, showing the shift from just knowing stuff about engineering to running a whole organization. The idea that a leader shouldn’t be the only person who can solve problems, but instead should create a team that can keep going on its own, is a strong point.

It shows how Google’s guidelines are customized for different programming languages, keeping up with changing standards. The chapter also points out the importance of updating rules regularly, as seen in Google’s change from CamelCase to snake_case in Python. This shows the need for guidelines that can adapt in a fast-changing engineering world.\n\n\nReflection\nThe chapter provides a thorough understanding of the importance of regulations and standards in a large-scale engineering setting. It demonstrates how the foundation of coding practices is made up of strict guidelines and flexible rules that are in line with the objectives and values of the organization. Clarity and minimization of unnecessary overhead are achieved by concentrating on the development of rules that support certain objectives rather than producing comprehensive rulebooks. In the end, the chapter highlights the crucial role that rules play in creating an engineering environment that is solid to time and scale, allowing for efficient codebase maintenance and fostering a shared development methodology.\n\n\nUse-Case\nFor Chasten to succeed, policies guaranteeing scalability and adaptability must be put into place. Through regular evaluation, we can modify regulations to accommodate future needs. It’s important to keep flexibility and refrain from turning every practice into a strict rule. A good strategy requires that these rules be followed consistently. Whenever possible, making enforcement will streamline the procedure and guarantee that the set practices are followed.

Unit tests focus on the smallest functional “units,” as opposed to more general testing.\n\n\nReflection and Use-Case\nBecause of the many test types, this chapter’s extensive insights on test writing could occasionally feel overwhelming. My goal is to get a deeper comprehension and application of these principles, particularly in upcoming scientific computing initiatives. I’ll reevaluate how we write tests going forward, trying to divide up complex test cases and stay away from duplication. Instead than making our testing suite slower with excessively many integration tests, we should concentrate on writing clear, effective tests. Our testing in Chasten will be streamlined by incorporating the “Don’t Repeat Yourself” idea, guaranteeing concise, effective test cases free of needless duplication."

As statements that outline specific conditions that are anticipated to hold true at runtime, assertions serve a number of important functions. Assertions automate checks, provide documentation, and facilitate debugging, all of which greatly improve the dependability, maintainability, and efficiency of software systems.\n\n\nReflection and Use-Case\nComparable to safety checks in computer programming are assertions. They aid with the early detection of errors, the documentation of intended functionality, and the maintenance of dependability and manageability. They serve as a sort of security guard, seeing problems before they become bigger ones. By ensuring that everyone is aware of how the code should behave, they also improve teamwork. Put simply, assertions are essential to maintaining the quality of software. We’ve already implemented assertions into our chasten tests, and they’re working really well."

This technique looks at runs of the program that work and ones that don’t, and it tries to find connections between those runs and specific lines of code. It uses a collector function to keep track of which lines of code are used when the program runs with different inputs. Then, it ranks these lines of code based on how often they appear in runs that don’t work. This helps identify areas of the code where problems are more likely to occur. By comparing how often different lines are used in runs that work and those that don’t, this method can point out suspicious parts of the code, making it easier to find potential issues. Looking at the connection between what happens when the code runs and whether it succeeds or fails is very helpful for debugging, especially when it focuses on the parts of the code that are most often linked to failures. These insights give us important clues about whether specific lines of code are related to program failures, making debugging easier.\n\n\nReflection and Use-Case\nThe lessons we’ve learned show just how vital it is to connect the dots between what we do and what happens next, especially when we’re trying to figure out why things go wrong. But I have to admit, I’m a bit uncertain about how smoothly we can incorporate these methods because our project is quite complex. Nevertheless, I’m determined to dive deeper into these techniques and see if we can make them work for our project. I truly believe that if we give them a shot, they could make a big difference in how we pinpoint and fix issues in our programs, making them more dependable in the long run."
