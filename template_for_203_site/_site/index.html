<h1>About the Author</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Jason Gyamfi, and I am looking forward to collaborating with everyone throughout the semester.</p>
</section>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se1">SE1</h2>
<section id="summary" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>The book “Software Engineering at Google” talks about the difference between “programming” and “software engineering”. People often use these words in the same way, but they mean different things. Students usually learn about computers and then get jobs where they write code. “Software engineering” sounds more detailed, like it uses deeper knowledge, similar to jobs like building planes or bridges. But making software hasn’t always been as strict or careful as these jobs. As we use software more in our daily lives, we need to be more careful making it. This book gives tips on how to do that better.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflection" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflection">Reflection</h4>
<p>After reflecting on the preface of this book, I feel that I will gain a different perspective on the world of computer science. I say this because I never realized how the terms “programming” and “software egineering” tie hand and hand. I feel that after reading this book I will learn about the evolution of programming and software egineering and overall gain a better understanding of the two.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-case" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case">Use-Case</h4>
<p>The information I absored from the topics covered in this reading can apply to the Chasten project in many ways. For one understanding the differences between programming and software engineering will lead us to define roles clearly when working together. Furthermore, the continuous learning aspect of it. Since software engineering is always evolving, as stated in the preface, it will be encouraged for us students to continously update the project.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fb1">FB1</h2>
<section id="summary-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-1">Summary</h4>
<p>The Fuzzing book’s section on software testing offered helpful information. It underlined how testing helps identify and address issues, improving software’s stability and dependability. Yet, it also made clear that testing can’t promise error-free code. Using an example like the divide-by-zero issue in the square root function, the chapter demonstrated the variation of testing, enhancing my grasp of this key software component.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflection-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflection-1">Reflection</h4>
<p>After reading and reflecting on this chapter of Fuzzing Book I realized how essential testing is to coding Testing helps you find the very small errors with your code that you may not realize is in your code.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-case-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-1">Use-Case</h4>
<p>The information I learned can be implemented in the chasten project in many ways. For example testing is somethig that will be used in our program in order to check if our codes are running properly.</p>

<h1>Week 3</h1>
<section id="se2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se2">SE2</h2>
<section id="summary-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-2">Summary</h4>
<p>The text explains the differences between making software and just coding. It talks about how long the code will be used and its ability to change with new tech or business needs. Making software involves teamwork and has its own challenges, like organizing the team and setting rules. As a project grows, it needs to work well and grow properly. Making decisions in software is complex, and sometimes you have to choose between not-so-perfect options. A software engineer’s job is to aim for long-lasting software and manage the growth of the project.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflection-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflection-2">Reflection</h4>
<p>This text emphasizes the need for forward-thinking in software creation. The idea is to think about keeping software good for years, not just for a short time, which promotes a flexible approach. Hyrum’s Law shows how developers often use what they see in software, even if it’s not a main part. The chapter also talks about the importance of individual learning and sharing what you know. This personal development helps the whole organization move forward.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-case-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-2">Use-Case</h4>
<p>I believe it’s crucial when developing software for our project to consider the trade-offs involved. It’s essential to understand the advantages and disadvantages of our software before releasing it. We shouldn’t release software that has major flaws that could harm our code.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="fb2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fb2">FB2</h2>
<section id="summary-3" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-3">Summary</h4>
<p>The “Code Coverage” section in the Fuzzing book gives a basic understanding of how code coverage works in fuzz testing. It shows how important it is for finding software flaws and gives useful tips on how to use techniques that guide fuzzing with coverage. This part also explains white box and black box testing, which are crucial for making sure software is of high quality. White box testing looks at the code inside, whereas black box testing checks how it works from the outside without knowing the internal details.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflection-3" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflection-3">Reflection</h4>
<p>In this section, I learned a lot about how important testing is in creating software. The chapter really focused on the need to test in many different situations, not just on writing the code. It’s about making sure the code works right and can handle different situations. The book also went through different ways to fix problems in the code, and I thought that part was really helpful.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-case-3" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-3">Use-Case</h4>
<p>For our goal, it’s very important to write good test cases to make sure the project stays in great shape for a long time. We have to make testing just as important as making and putting in new code.</p>
</section>

<section id="se3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se3">SE3</h2>
<section id="summary-4" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-4">Summary</h4>
<p>This chapter points out the importance of teamwork in software engineering at Google, showing that creating software is a team effort. It emphasizes values like being humble, respectful, and trustworthy. While some people believe in the idea of a lone developer, real success in software comes from teams working well together. For software groups to last and do well, they need a strong team-focused culture, not just individual work. This mindset helps teams be creative, take risks, and understand that mistakes happen, all while supporting each other.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflection-4" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflection-4">Reflection</h4>
<p>This article really opened my eyes. I’ve never made software with a team before, so all of this is new to me. Learning about how to work well in a team is helpful</p>
</section>
<section id="use-case-4" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-4">Use-Case</h4>
<p>The guide discussed in the chapter can be a great tool for our software engineering class, especially during tough projects. It can assist us in building an effective team. For example, if there’s a difficult system or method, rather than pushing back against it, we can aim to get it and adjust by collaborating and finding solutions as a team.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="fb3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fb3">FB3</h2>
<section id="summary-5" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-5">Summary</h4>
<p>This chapter explains fuzzing as an effective testing method. Fuzzing means using random or almost random inputs to find problems in software. The chapter goes into detail about different fuzzing methods, like grammar-based and mutation-based fuzzing, and explains important ideas like checking how much code is tested and analyzing crashes. The chapter highlights how using automated tools for fuzzing can help find and use software issues more efficiently.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflection-5" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflection-5">Reflection</h4>
<p>The chapter dives deep into different fuzzing methods, like grammar-based and mutation-based fuzzing, giving readers a thorough grasp of this testing method. It also stresses the importance of ideas like how much code is tested and understanding crashes, which are crucial in spotting software problems. The main point of the chapter is the importance of using automated tools for fuzzing to find and fix issues quickly and effectively. This makes the chapter a must-read for those aiming to improve software strength and safety.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-case-5" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-5">Use-Case</h4>
<p>The chapter gives us deep knowledge about fuzzing, showing its importance in testing. Just as working together is key in software, fuzzing is a great and affordable way to better test our code and find weak spots in our software. We could use this method to test the Chasten program, especially for bugs caused by inputting code or using config files. While this method could be very useful for Chasten, I think it might be even more beneficial later in the semester when we begin working on the Astronaught tool.</p>

<section id="se4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se4">SE4</h2>
<section id="summary-6" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-6">Summary</h4>
<p>The main idea of the “Knowledge Sharing” chapter in SE is about how organizations in software engineering work. An organization in this field is essentially a team of engineers and developers working together to build and take care of software. Like in any group, there are hurdles that need to be jumped over to reach success in your project or final objective. Sometimes, software organizations struggle to build a learning environment where everyone feels comfortable admitting what they don’t know in order to learn from their peers. It’s about being willing to share your own gaps in knowledge to benefit from the knowledge of others. You have to be open and share to learn and grow.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflection-6" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflection-6">Reflection</h4>
<p>Reading through the chapter made me think about what is needed to create a space where everyone is always learning. You need to make sure that if you don’t know something in a particular area, you talk to others and ask for help. This is true for experts in a field as well. As a software engineer, it’s crucial to step out of your comfort zone and take on new challenges. You should also be ready to help out and share what you know with others who might not be as far along as you are, whether it’s in a specific area or in solving a particular problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-case-6" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-6">Use-Case</h4>
<p>I believe that as a class, we are gradually getting a better grasp of chasten’s tools and their functions during its development process. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to acknowledge that some of us are progressing faster than others. Those who are more advanced should be willing to share their insights and knowledge. Additionally, when selecting issues to address, it’s vital to diversify our focus. This includes working on problems related to both the source code and the documentation.</p>

<section id="summary-7" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-7">Summary</h4>
<p>This section of the Fuzzing book is about mutation analysis, a method of testing that helps us figure out how well a group of test cases can find problems. It checks if the tests can notice small tweaks or mutations in a function’s source code. The book refers to these tweaks as “artificial faults.” Here’s an example to show what that means:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> triangle_m1(a, b, c):</span>

<p>The idea of mutation analysis from the Fuzzing Book’s chapter gives us a useful way to see how good our test collections really are. It shows that just looking at how much of the structure the tests cover isn’t enough, as it doesn’t always mean the program’s results will be right. The code samples given, named ineffective_test_1 and ineffective_test_2, clearly show the difference between getting a lot of coverage and actually finding the software’s errors.</p>

<p>The “Engineering for Equity” chapter in the Software Engineering book talks about how important it is to notice and fix bias in software creation. It highlights the need for more variety and acceptance in the field to make sure software is made for all kinds of users. The chapter explains that unintentional bias can hurt groups of people who are not well represented, leading to problems in creating products. For example, it brings up a situation where Google’s picture-identifying technology didn’t take race into account, showing how things can go wrong. The chapter underlines how crucial it is for engineers to learn about and understand different kinds of users and their challenges, and it talks about the need for teams to be culturally diverse. It pushes for a design approach that includes everyone from the start and puts responsibility on engineers to create fair systems. The chapter encourages constant learning and progress, checking how fair systems are, and working with experts in diversity and inclusion to make software that is more inclusive.</p>

<p>The “How to Lead a Team” chapter starts by explaining the two different leadership positions: a manager and a tech lead. Both roles are crucial to a team’s success and need to be present at the same time. The chapter also introduces the idea of servant leadership, which aims to foster a culture of humility, respect, and trust, while meeting the needs of the team members and ensuring their well-being. Additionally, the chapter talks about “Antipatterns,” which are behaviors and practices that managers should avoid. Examples of these harmful patterns include hiring people who are easy to control and manipulate, overlooking team members who are struggling with their technical work, and neglecting the personal needs of the team.</p>

<p>Managers and tech leads need different abilities. It’s possible to be both. However, a manager typically guides people and organizes plans to complete tasks, while a tech lead takes charge of engineering projects and helps with various software applications. I see myself as a mix of both, but I lean more towards being a tech lead. When I really grasp a topic, I take the lead on engineering tasks and provide assistance with various software applications in that domain.</p>

<p>The chapter on Leading at Scale talks about how a person moves from doing tasks alone to leading a team and even more. It looks at how engineers often become leaders of teams and points out that leaders tackle big, less concrete problems. The chapter outlines three main ideas for leaders: Always Be Deciding, which means choosing strategies; Always Be Leaving, which is about making the team work well on its own so the leader isn’t the only one who can fix problems; and Always Be Scaling, which is about looking after your own energy and helping the team stand on its own. The key to being a good leader, the chapter says, is to create teams that can operate independently, foster strong leadership, establish good ways of working, and keep a culture of sticking with it over time.</p>

It highlights how important it is for leaders to let their team members do things on their own and to not spread themselves too thin, while still helping their team improve. The ideas of Deciding, Leaving, and Scaling are given as a simple guide to being a good leader, showing the shift from just knowing stuff about engineering to running a whole organization. The idea that a leader shouldn’t be the only person who can solve problems, but instead should create a team that can keep going on its own, is a strong point. The chapter also talks about how success in leadership means solving problems over and over, facing new issues, and always learning and getting better as a leader.</p>

<p>The chapter on Statistical Debugging in the debugging book introduces a method that helps find which lines of code might be causing problems in a program. This technique looks at runs of the program that work and ones that don’t, and it tries to find connections between those runs and specific lines of code. It uses a collector function to keep track of which lines of code are used when the program runs with different inputs. Then, it ranks these lines of code based on how often they appear in runs that don’t work. This helps identify areas of the code where problems are more likely to occur. By comparing how often different lines are used in runs that work and those that don’t, this method can point out suspicious parts of the code, making it easier to find potential issues. Looking at the connection between what happens when the code runs and whether it succeeds or fails is very helpful for debugging, especially when it focuses on the parts of the code that are most often linked to failures. These insights give us important clues about whether specific lines of code are related to program failures, making debugging easier.</p>

Nevertheless, I’m determined to dive deeper into these techniques and see if we can make them work for our project. I truly believe that if we give them a shot, they could make a big difference in how we pinpoint and fix issues in our programs, making them more dependable in the long run.</p>
